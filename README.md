# Bank Loan Report Dashboard (Excel, SQL & Power BI Project).


### Project Overview:

- This project analyzes Bank Loan Data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI to evaluate loan performance, borrower behavior, and portfolio quality. It tracks key KPIs such as total applications, funded amounts, repayments, and interest rates. The interactive dashboards provide insights into good vs. bad loans, regional trends, and borrower demographics, enabling data-driven decisions to improve loan management and reduce financial risk.

          - Determine Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
          - Identify trends over time to measure loan demand.

##### 2. Total Funded Amount.
          - Calculate the total loan amount disbursed.
          - Analyze MTD and MoM funded amounts.
          - Track growth or decline in loan disbursements.

##### 3. Total Amount Received.
          - Track the total amount received from borrowers (repayments).
          - Measure MTD and MoM changes to assess repayment flow.

##### 4. Average Interest Rate.
          - Compute the average interest rate across all issued loans.
          - Monitor MTD and MoM variations to identify cost trends.

##### 5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).
          - Evaluate borrowers’ financial health through DTI ratio.
